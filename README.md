# Angular-Rep 

**Building my first app in Angular :)** 

**Why did you choose this subject?**
I choose to teach myself Angular simply because when researching it, it seemed interesting enough and the fact that it's popular!

**How were you first made aware of it?**
Initially James, the instructor told me that originally our class was set to learn Angular but then we were taught react instead,
in my curious mind I decided okay well let's learn it !!

**What problem does it solve?**
Angular conveniently relieves the action of actively manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model), 
dues to its two-way data binding approach.

**How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?**
It solves the problem because it saves the developer time and efforts to code, translate and update the DOM elements.

**Why does one use it?**
Well, not to praise but it was created by google!, 
also Angular is a complete solution for rapid front-end development. 
No other plugins or frameworks are necessary to build a data-driven web application.

**What are the alternatives?**
Ember && Meteor 

**What is it similar to, if anything?**
Without a doubt Angular is very similar to React, 

**What is the history of this technology?**
Angular was developed in 2009 by two google employees. The two originally envisioned their project, GetAngular,
to be an end-to-end tool that allowed web designers to interact with both the frontend and the backend.

**Who built it and why?**
Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons 

**Who is maintaining it?**
Maintained by Google, since Google owns it. 

**What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?**
It's my first app so hey I haven't used it enough to like or dislike. I feel neutral about Angularjs.

**What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?**
Biggest hurdle was getting stuck in an article that i didn't understand and reading it over and over and over!

**What resources do you recommend for interested students?**
I believe Google && Youtube are the best honestly. Watch tutorials and practice.
**What article or forum was most helpful to you in learning this?**
https://angular.io/guide/quickstart

**What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?**
1. What is Angularjs?
